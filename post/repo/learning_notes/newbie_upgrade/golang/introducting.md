## why go

Go was built at Google, a company synonymous with Search and Distributed Computing, with Kubernetes. They wanted a language that was fast, worked well with **automated code review** and **formatting** and **allowed a large team to write large scale software effectively**, catered to the **multi-core** and **networking era**. All other major languages are at least a decade old. **They were created in an era where memory was costly, where there were no massive clusters or multi-core processors**.

**A list of features:**

- Unused imports/variables are compiler errors.
- Semi-colons not needed, the compiler adds them at the line end.
- A folder $GOPATH, as it is called contains all your Go code.
- There is only one standard way to write Go code, use gofmt.
- Batteries included standard library.
- Compiled language, thus very fast.
- Webapps can be written without a framework.
- Has concurrency built in, just attach the word go before a function call to run it in its own goroutine.
- Supports Unicode.
- No language change from 1.0 to 1.7
